# An-Intelligient-IOT-Sensing-System-for-Rail-vehicles-Using-IOT-and-Tinyml
In this project, I developed a Intelligent IOT System that leverages IoT sensors and machine learning algorithms to monitor and analyze various physical parameters. The system is designed to detect and predict anomalies in real-time, enhancing the safety and efficiency of the environment where it is deployed.
